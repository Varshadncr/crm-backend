# CRM Application Backend

This project is a **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** system backend built using **Node.js**, **Sequelize**, and **SQLite**. The backend provides a set of APIs to manage customer data, including contacts, companies, and interactions. It includes user authentication, CRUD operations, and data validations.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register and login users with JWT-based authentication.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete customer records.
- **Search and Filtering**: Search customers by name, email, or phone, and filter by company.
- **Environment Configuration**: Configurable for both development and production environments.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. If not, you can download and install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **SQLite**: The project uses SQLite for database management, but you can switch to another database (like PostgreSQL or MySQL) by modifying the database configuration.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Varshadncr/crm-backend.git
   cd crm-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```env
   DB_USER=your-database-user
   DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
   DB_NAME=your-database-name
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   DB_HOST=your-database-host
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start on port `5000` by default.
